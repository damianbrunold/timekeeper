Timekeeper is a small python tk based utility for
tracking and reporting times. You can add your
activity categories to the file activities.txt.

In the morning, you start timekeeper and leave it
running for the rest of the day. Whenever you
switch an activity, you press the corresponding
button.

If you suspend an activity, you can press stop,
e.g. if you take a break.

At the end of the day, a report is written into
the data folder.
